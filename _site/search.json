Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\ntwo graphsthree graphs\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above is plotted using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Creating composite figures with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\n\nCode\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.4, \n                   top = 0.98)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Creating a composite figure using patchwork and ggtheme\nThe below figure was created using patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package. The code allows us to apply thte theme to the composite figure without individually editing each individual graph.\n\n\nCode\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

    "text": "4 Grammar of graphics\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\n\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statistical transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-axis title, or legend background."

    "text": "4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts:\n\nCreating a ggplot object using interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) \nUsing girafe() of ggiraph to create an interactive svg object.\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations. We can refer here for a cheat sheet on css.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:#1C6EA4; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:white;\nborder: 2px solid #99CCFF;\npadding: 2px\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function tooltip is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, linewidth = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Hover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill:lightgreen\"))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nElements associated with a data_id (i.e. CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse-over. The default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n4.6 Styling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\nThe css customisation is encoded directly in this example\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 Combining tooltip and hover effect\nWe can also combine the tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph using the code chunk below.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over. At the same time, the tooltip will show the CLASS.\n\n\n\n\n4.8 Click effect with onclick\nonclick argument of ggiraph provides hotlink interactivity on the web.\nThe code chunk below shown an example of onclick.\n\nexam_data$onclick &lt;- sprintf(\"window.open(\\\"%s%s\\\")\",\n\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Primary%20school\",\nas.character(exam_data$ID))\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(onclick = onclick),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Web document link with a data object will be displayed on the web browser upon mouse click.\nclick actions must be a string column in the dataset containing valid javascript instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.9 Coordinated Multiple Views with ggiraph\nCoordinated multiple views methods has been implemented in the data visualisation below.\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = ID, \n        tooltip = ID),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = ID, \n        tooltip = ID),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(code = print(p1 + p2), \n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 3,\n       options = list(\n         opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),\n         opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")\n         )\n       ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a data point of one of the dotplot is selected, the corresponding data point ID on the second data visualisation will be highlighted too.\nIn order to build a coordinated multiple views as shown in the example above, the following programming strategy will be used:\n\nAppropriate interactive functions of ggiraph will be used to create the multiple views.\npatchwork function of patchwork package will be used inside girafe function to create the interactive coordinated multiple views.\n\nThe data_id aesthetic is critical to link observations between plots and the tooltip aesthetic is optional but nice to have when mouse over a point."

    "text": "6 Interactive Data Visualisation - crosstalk methods!\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n6.1 Interactive Data Table: DT package\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\ndatatable(exam_data, class = \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Linked brushing: crosstalk method\nCode chunk below is used to implement coordinated brushing\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\nSetting the `off` event (i.e., 'plotly_deselect') to match the `on` event (i.e., 'plotly_selected'). You can change this default via the `highlight()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots.\n\nThese options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk.\nIn some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\n\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.\n\nWarning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!."
