## Learning Outcomes

1.  Control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in **ggrepel** package,
2.  Create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in **ggthemes** and **hrbrthemes** packages,
3.  Plot composite figures by combining ggplot2 graphs using **patchwork** package.

## Getting started

### Installing and loading required libraries

In this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.
-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.
-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.
-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

The code chunk below will check whether these packages have been installed and also will load them onto the working R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, tidyverse)
```

### Importing data

For the purpose of this exercise, a data file called *Exam_data* will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.

The code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

There are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.

-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

## Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel

One of the challenges in plotting statistical graphs is annotation, particularly with a large number of data points.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8

ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              linewidth=0.5) +  
  geom_label(aes(label = ID), 
             hjust = .5, 
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")

```

::: callout-info
The labels for each data point obscure the actual information from the graph.
:::

[**ggrepel**](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap02/img/image3.jpg){width="40"} is an extension of **ggplot2** package which provides `geoms` for **ggplot2** to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right.

We simply replace `geom_text()` with [`geom_text_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html) and `geom_label()` with `geom_label_repel`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8

ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              linewidth=0.5) +  
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), 
                   fontface = "bold") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

## Beyond ggplot2 Themes

ggplot2 comes with eight [built-in themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html), they are: `theme_gray()`, `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_light()`, `theme_linedraw()`, `theme_minimal()`, and `theme_void()`.

::: panel-tabset
### theme_bw()

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") 
```

### theme_dark()

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100) +
  theme_dark() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") 
```

### theme_linedraw()

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") 
```

### theme_void()

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100) +
  theme_void() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") 
```

### Working with ggtheme package

[**ggthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/index.html) provides [‘ggplot2’ themes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, [Fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail), ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.pinterest.com/wsjgraphics/wsj-graphics/), among others.

In the example below, *The Economist* theme is used.

::: panel-tabset
#### ggthemes

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_economist()
```

#### ggplot2

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")

```
:::

Other geoms and scales for ggplot2 from ggtheme package can be viewed at [this vignette](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/).

### Working with hrbrthemes package

[**hrbrthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hrbrthemes/index.html) package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are places as well as fonts that are used.

The second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used. Consult [this vignette](https://hrbrmstr.github.io/hrbrthemes/articles/why_hrbrthemes.html) to learn more.

#### theme_ipsum

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_ipsum()
```

#### customised theme_ipsum()

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,
              base_size = 15,
              grid = "Y")
```

::: callout-note
-   `axis_title_size` argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18,
-   `base_size` argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and
-   `grid` argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.

## Beyond Single Graphs

It is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. This section explores how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, we will create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.

::: panel-tabset
#### Math scores

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8

p1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") 

p1
```

#### English scores

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8

p2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of English scores")

p2

```

#### English vs Math scores

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 8

p3 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x= MATHS, 
                 y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              linewidth=0.5) +  
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")

p3
```

### Creating Composite Graphics: pathwork methods

There are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as [`grid.arrange()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html) of **gridExtra** package and [`plot_grid()`](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/reference/plot_grid.html) of [**cowplot**](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html) package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.

Patchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:

-   Two-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.
-   Parenthesis () to create a subplot group.
-   Two-Row Layout using the Division Sign `/`

::: panel-tabset
### two graphs

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10

p1 + p2
```

### three graphs

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10

(p1 / p2) | p3
```

The figure above is plotted using:

-   “/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,
-   “\|” operator to place the plots beside each other,
-   “()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.
:::

### Creating composite figures with tag

In order to identify subplots in text, **patchwork** also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 10

((p1 / p2) | p3) + 
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')
```

### Creating figure with insert

Beside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With [`inset_element()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/inset_element.html) of **patchwork**, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 10

p3 + inset_element(p2, 
                   left = 0.02, 
                   bottom = 0.7, 
                   right = 0.4, 
                   top = 0.98)

```

### Creating a composite figure using patchwork and ggtheme

The below figure was created using patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package. The code allows us to apply thte theme to the composite figure without individually editing each individual graph.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 12
patchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3
patchwork & theme_economist()
```
